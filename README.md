    from selenium import webdriver
# Initialize the WebDriver (change to your browser of choice)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
# Scenario 1: Log in to your WordPress site.
def test_login():
    driver.get("https://your-wordpress-site.com")
    username = driver.find_element_by_id("username")  # Replace with actual element locator
    password = driver.find_element_by_id("password")  # Replace with actual element locator
    login_button = driver.find_element_by_id("login-button")  # Replace with actual element locator
    username.send_keys("your_username")
    password.send_keys("your_password")
    login_button.click()
# Run the test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_login()
```
Repeat this process to create scripts for the other scenarios.
**Step 4: Store Credentials Securely**
Store your credentials securely, such as in environment variables or a `.env` file. Ensure that you do not share your actual credentials in the GitHub repository.
**Step 5: Implement Test Logic**
For each scenario, implement the actions and verifications using Selenium WebDriver. Follow the provided steps for each scenario.
**Step 6: Handle Settings and Saving**
Ensure that settings are saved correctly after making changes, as per the instructions.
**Step 7: Create a README.md File**
Write a detailed README.md file that explains how to set up the testing environment, install dependencies, and run the test suite. Include instructions for running individual test scripts. Also, provide information on how to set up the `.env` file with credentials securely.
**Step 8: Version Control with Git**
Initialize a Git repository in your project directory.
**Step 9: Push to GitHub**
Create a public GitHub repository and push your code to it. Share the GitHub repository link with others.
This step-by-step guide should help you create your automation test suite and share it on GitHub. Be sure to replace placeholder values in your scripts with actual element locators, credentials, and URLs from your WordPress site.
